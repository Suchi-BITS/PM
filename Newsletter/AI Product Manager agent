# ** 10-Step Guide to Building Your PM AI Copilot **#
## Step 1: Set up a persistent project with context
Create a memory-enabled thread in your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini)
Add real context about your company, product, users, team, and past performance reviews
Use specific prompts that make the AI feel like a team member rather than a random assistant
Step 2: Analyze qualitative feedback using real user data
Export user feedback (app store reviews, surveys) as a CSV
Ask AI to extract themes with exact quotes and data-backed clusters
Challenge the AI by asking what it might have missed to ensure comprehensive analysis
Step 3: Preserve user voice with real quotes
Avoid over-summarization by requesting raw, unfiltered language from users
Request exact quotes with ratings attached to maintain emotional tone and specific phrasing
Focus on understanding pain points in the users' own words rather than abstractions
Step 4: Use AI to audit your calendar and time allocation
Upload calendar screenshots to your AI copilot
Ask for analysis of time spent, patterns, and inefficiencies
Request visualizations like pie charts to identify time drains and gather data for discussions with management
Step 5: Add rigor to decisions like A/B testing
Teach your copilot your decision frameworks by feeding it your methodology
Ask AI to create decision trees for evaluating new features
Use the AI to apply consistent logic when making complex decisions
Step 6: Simulate hard conversations before you have them
Describe upcoming difficult conversations in a casual, conversational way
Use role-playing with AI to practice both sides of challenging discussions
Pay attention to tone, phrasing, and emotional dynamics during simulations
Step 7: Teach your AI to explain technical concepts simply
Ask your copilot to explain complex technical topics in plain language
Request the AI to quiz you to verify understanding
Ask for examples relevant to your job to make abstract concepts practical
Step 8: Use live documentation during meetings
Document next steps in real-time during meetings rather than waiting until after
Use AI to organize rough meeting notes into clear action items
Share updated plans directly in communication channels to demonstrate organization
Step 9: Record short Looms to reduce meetings
Create brief (<1 minute) video explanations instead of scheduling meetings
Use Loom for product changes, technical handoffs, or cross-functional decisions
Utilize Loom AI to enhance videos with additional context or markers
Step 10: Build a habit of product scrapbooking
Continuously collect user feedback, support tickets, and relevant conversations in Notion
Create dedicated pages for feature ideas, pain points, and user behavior patterns
Use Notion AI search to query your growing database of insights when needed
